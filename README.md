# Automated Seed Germination Monitoring System

This project involves developing an automated seed germination monitoring system that integrates an IoT incubator with a mobile app, machine learning, and remote control capabilities. The system is designed to monitor and manage the germination of seeds, providing real-time updates and control to users.

## Overview
The automated seed germination monitoring system is designed to help researchers efficiently monitor the germination process of seeds. The system consists of:

- An IoT incubator built using Arduino.
- A mobile app developed with Flutter for remote monitoring and control.
- An SSD MobileNet machine learning model for detecting and counting seeds.
- Remote temperature and humidity control via the mobile app.

## Features

- Real-time Monitoring: Monitor the germination status of seeds in real-time via the mobile app.
- Remote Control: Remotely control the temperature and humidity of the incubator.
- Seed Detection and Counting: Automatically detect and count seeds using the SSD MobileNet model.
- User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use mobile app interface developed with Flutter.
